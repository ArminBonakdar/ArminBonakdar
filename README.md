## Hi there, I'm Armin! 👋
About Me

I'm a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for biomechanics, mechatronics, and machine learning. I earned my M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Alberta, where I graduated with a 4.0/4.0 GPA. Right now, I’m a Research Assistant at NCBLab, diving deep into biomechanical analysis, sensor fusion, and developing AI-driven algorithms for human motion studies. I love solving real-world challenges with Python and cutting-edge technology.

Experience & Interests

📌 Research & Development: Motion analysis, biomechanics, and AI-driven algorithms

💡 Machine Learning & Deep Learning: Working with deep learning models (like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras)

🔧 Technical Skills: Python, sensor integration, digital signal processing

🏀 Beyond Engineering: Basketball lover! Coaching and playing are my favorite ways to stay active.
